/**
 * The <b>Jetson</b> package implements a subset of {@code javax.json}
 * interfaces which is fully sufficient to work with Json. It also provides
 * annotation {@code @Json} and methods to encode and decode Json values.
 * <p>
 * But most of all it can decode a Json text into an instantiated object! This
 * allows setting a subset of attributes in that object without overwriting
 * others.
 *
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * <p>
 * Annotate getter method like:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Json( converter = ReturnTypeConverter4son.class )
 * ReturnType getter() {...}
 * </pre>
 *
 * Supplying a converter is optional.
